### Graph Neural Network for Predicting the Parameters of the Antoine Equation

GRAPPA is a machine learning model based on a graph neural network architecture that allows predicting the paremters of the Antoine equation only based on molecular structure.
This repository contains the trained model, an examples to show how to calculate vapor pressure, the underlying Antoine parameters and (normal) boiling points. The model only requires the SMILES representation of the molecule as input.
